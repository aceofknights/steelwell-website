              Hi there! My name is Chris Wells, and I'm passionate about
              software engineering. I currently reside in Knoxville, TN, where
              I'm on an exciting journey to become a skilled software engineer.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I recently graduated with honors from Pellissippi State Technical
              Community College, where I received recognition for my dedication
              and excellence in computer science. My time at Pellissippi State
              equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge that have prepared
              me for the challenges and opportunities ahead.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Now, I'm gearing up to take the next step in my educational
              journey by enrolling in Western Governors University (WGU) to
              further expand my expertise and achieve new heights in the field
              of technology.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              One of my favorite things to do is to build and create. That's why
              I'm thrilled to be working on this website, where I can showcase
              various projects I'm passionate about. From web development to
              mobile applications and everything in between, I'm eager to
              explore different technologies and share my creations with the
              world.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Join me on this exciting adventure as I continue to learn, grow,
              and innovate in the ever-evolving world of software engineering!
